For example:\n *\n * ```js\n * var state = {\n *   name: 'foo',\n *   url: '/foo',\n *   template: '<h1>foo</h1>',\n *   controller: 'FooController'\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * is simply syntactic sugar for:\n *\n * ```js\n * var state = {\n *   name: 'foo',\n *   url: '/foo',\n *   views: {\n *     $default: {\n *       template: '<h1>foo</h1>',\n *       controller: 'FooController\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n *\n * If a state definition contains a `views:` object, any view properties set directly on the state are ignored.\n * Thus, this is an invalid state defintion:\n *\n * ```js\n * var state = {\n *   name: 'foo',\n *   url: '/foo',\n *   controller: 'FooController, // invalid because views: exists\n *   views: {\n *     header: {\n *       template: '<h1>header</h1>'\n *     }\n *   }\n * }\n * ```\n */\nexport interface Ng1StateDeclaration extends _Ng1StateDeclaration, Ng1ViewDeclaration {\n  /**\n   * An optional object which defines multiple named views.\n   *\n   * Each key is the name of a view, and each value is a [[Ng1ViewDeclaration]].\n   * Unnamed views are internally renamed to `$default`.\n   *\n   * A view's name is used to match an active `<ui-view>` directive in the DOM.
