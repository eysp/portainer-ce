This is commonly referred to as a\n   * \"default substate\".\n   *\n   * @example\n   * ```js\n   * // ng2\n   * transitionService.onBefore({ to: 'home' }, (trans: Transition) =>\n   *     trans.router.stateService.target(\"home.dashboard\"));\n   * ```\n   *\n   * #### Data Driven Default Substate\n   *\n   * This example provides data-driven default substate functionality. It matches on a transition to any state\n   * which has `defaultSubstate: \"some.sub.state\"` defined.  See: [[Transition.to]] which returns the \"to state\"\n   * definition.\n   *\n   * @example\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * // state declaration\n   * {\n   *   name: 'home',\n   *   template: '<div ui-view/>',\n   *   defaultSubstate: 'home.dashboard'\n   * }\n   *\n   * var criteria = {\n   *   to: function(state) {\n   *     return state.defaultSubstate != null;\n   *   }\n   * }\n   *\n   * $transitions.onBefore(criteria, function(trans: Transition) {\n   *   var substate = trans.to().defaultSubstate;\n   *   return trans.router.stateService.target(substate);\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   *\n   * #### Require authentication\n   *\n   * This example cancels a transition to a state which requires authentication, if the user is not currently authenticated.\n   *\n   * This example assumes a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'requireauth'` state.\n   * This example assumes `MyAuthService` synchronously returns a boolean from `isAuthenticated()`.\n   *\n   * #### Example:\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * $transitions.onBefore( { to: 'requireauth.**' }, function(trans) {\n   *   var myAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');\n   *   // If isAuthenticated returns false, the transition is cancelled.\n   *   return myAuthService.isAuthenticated();\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.\n   * @param callback the hook function which will be invoked.\n   * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.\n   */\n  onBefore(matchCriteria: HookMatchCriteria, callback: TransitionHookFn, options?: HookRegOptions): Function;\n\n  /**\n   * Registers a [[TransitionHookFn]], called when a transition starts.\n   *\n   * Registers a transition lifecycle hook, which is invoked as a transition starts running.\n   * This hook can be useful to perform some asynchronous action before completing a transition.\n   *\n   * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.\n   *\n   * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.\n   * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.\n   *\n   * ### Lifecycle\n   *\n   * `onStart` hooks are invoked asynchronously when the Transition starts running.\n   * This happens after the `onBefore` phase is complete.\n   * At this point, the Transition has not yet exited nor entered any states.\n   * The registered `onStart` hooks are invoked in priority order.\n   *\n   * Note: A built-in `onStart` hook with high priority is used to fetch any eager resolve data.\n   *\n   * ### Return value\n   *\n   * The hook's return value can be used to pause, cancel, or redirect the current Transition.\n   * See [[HookResult]] for more information.\n   *\n   * ### Example\n   *\n   * #### Login during transition\n   *\n   * This example intercepts any transition to a state which requires authentication, when the user is\n   * not currently authenticated.  It allows the user to authenticate asynchronously, then resumes the\n   * transition.  If the user did not authenticate successfully, it redirects to the \"guest\" state, which\n   * does not require authentication.\n   *\n   * This example assumes:\n   * - a state tree where all states which require authentication are children of a parent `'auth'` state.\n   * - `MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()` synchronously returns a boolean.\n   * - `MyAuthService.authenticate()` presents a login dialog, and returns a promise which is resolved\n   *   or rejected, whether or not the login attempt was successful.\n   *\n   * #### Example:\n   * ```js\n   * // ng1\n   * $transitions.onStart( { to: 'auth.**' }, function(trans) {\n   *   var $state = trans.router.stateService;\n   *   var MyAuthService = trans.injector().get('MyAuthService');\n   *\n   *   // If the user is not authenticated\n   *   if (!MyAuthService.isAuthenticated()) {\n   *\n   *     // Then return a promise for a successful login.\n   *     // The transition will wait for this promise to settle\n   *\n   *     return MyAuthService.authenticate().catch(function() {\n   *\n   *       // If the authenticate() method failed for whatever reason,\n   *       // redirect to a 'guest' state which doesn't require auth.\n   *       return $state.target(\"guest\");\n   *     });\n   *   }\n   * });\n   * ```\n   *\n   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.\n   *

  * This example uses a service to log that a user has entered the admin section of an app.\n   * This assumes that there are substates of the \"admin\" state, such as \"admin.users\", \"admin.pages\", etc.\n   * @example\n   * ```\n   *\n   * $transitions.onEnter({ entering: 'admin' }, function(transition, state) {\n   *   var AuditService = trans.injector().get('AuditService');\n

called after a transition has errored.\n   *\n   * Registers a transition lifecycle hook, which is invoked after a transition has been rejected for any reason.\n   *\n   * See [[TransitionHookFn]] for the signature of the function.\n   *\n   * The [[HookMatchCriteria]] is used to determine which Transitions the hook should be invoked for.\n   * To match all Transitions, use an empty criteria object `{}`.\n   *\n   * ### Lifecycle\n   *\n   * The `onError` hooks are chained off the Transition's promise (see [[Transition.promise]]).\n   * If a Transition fails, its promise is rejected and the `onError` hooks are invoked.\n   * The `onError` hooks are invoked in priority order.\n   *\n   * Since these hooks are run after the transition is over, their return value is ignored.\n   *\n   * A transition \"errors\" if it was started, but failed to complete (for any reason).\n   * A *non-exhaustive list* of reasons a transition can error:\n   *\n   * - A transition was cancelled because a new transition started while it was still running (`Transition superseded`)\n   * - A transition was cancelled by a Transition Hook returning false\n   * - A transition was redirected by a Transition Hook returning a [[TargetState]]\n   * - A Transition Hook or resolve function threw an error\n   * - A Transition Hook returned a rejected promise\n   * - A resolve function returned a rejected promise\n   *\n   * To check the failure reason, inspect the return value of [[Transition.error]].\n   *\n   * Note: `onError` should be used for targeted error handling, or error recovery.\n   * For simple catch-all error reporting, use [[StateService.defaultErrorHandler]].\n   *\n   * ### Return value\n   *\n   * Since the Transition is already completed, the hook's return value is ignored\n   *\n   * @param matchCriteria defines which Transitions the Hook should be invoked for.\n   * @param callback the hook function which will be injected and invoked.\n   * @returns a function which deregisters the hook.\n   */\n  onError(matchCriteria: HookMatchCriteria, callback: TransitionHookFn, options?: HookRegOptions): Function;\n\n  /**\n   * Returns all the registered hooks of a given
